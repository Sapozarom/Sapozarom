# Introduction

<div id='introduction'></div>

Welcome to my portfolio profile. Here you can find a sample of my code. Every project has full docs, video presentation and online website ready for testing. There are only 2 projects, but they are big and I hope at least a bit interesting.  If you like my content please [contact me on]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/seb-koch/).


# About me
 
<div id='about-me'></div>

My name is Sebastian and I am 33-year-old engineer. For the last 2 years I tried to expand my knowledge on web development. Most of this time I have spent on backend technologies like PHP 7&8 and its framework Symfony. For the last few months I have also tried to get better in JavaScript and the industry relevant frontend framework which is REACT. My favorite way of improvement is learning by doing.  Right now my main goal is to start building commercial experience. If you are open to partnership, here you can find my [LinkedIn profile]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/seb-koch/).

## **Projects**

## HSBG - log analyzer


HSBG is my first big project. It is a third-party log analyzer that takes a file generated by the app client, parses it, saves data in DB and displays it as a step by step gameplay replay, which is unavailable in native app. This project is focused around PHP and backend solutions.

 ## Harmon - scheduling app 

<div id='repo-harmon'></div>

Harmon is a scheduling app designed around recurring activities in premade parties. 
It is a calendar that allow party members to leave their votes and decide which date is proper for their next session.
This project is my first attempt to build a big app with REACT frontend. I've paired it with API made with the PHP 8 framework Symfony 6.
